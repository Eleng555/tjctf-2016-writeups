# TJCTF 2016

CTFs, or Capture-The-Flags, are computer security competitions where contestants must solve challenges to find a flag (typically a string). These challenges can range in subject and difficulty from reverse engineering files to exploiting buffer overflows. In this book, we will write up the solutions to the challenges from [TJCTF](http://tjctf.org), a student-run CTF.

Before we begin, we'd like to give kudos to TJCTF for running such a great competition so smoothly, even while being attacked themselves. Although the site eventually went down as a result of DDoS, challenges have been released on [GitHub](https://github.com/TJCSec/tjctf-1516-released) for future reference.

Our team, Joe Bettina ended up placing 6th on the final scoreboard.
